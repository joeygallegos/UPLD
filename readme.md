# UPLD
## A private info repository system

### Scope
The whole scope of this repository was to make an easy-to-use system that was not only lightweight but also scaleable and would allow fast sharing of all types of files and information. From a technology standpoint we will be using AngularJS and a PHP/Eloquent backend for the RESTful services.

### User Interface
The interface should remain clean and easy to use and provide relevant and recent information at a glance. Records should load at a fast rate. We should consider using a cache system.
